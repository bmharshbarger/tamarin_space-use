data-raw. 
this data came from the data Sam sent and is found in tamarin_diaz_data. group_"x"_habitat files came from the original habitat_data folder in the home_range folder. 
there is one spreadsheet for each group (ba, lc, and ph). the columns in each spreadsheet are date (d/m/y), time, waypoint, lat, lon, habitat, boundary, 
boundary 2, height verbatim, height code, canopy level, canopy level code. boundary columns are only relevant when tamarins are in edge habitat.
